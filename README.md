# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis
 
## What is the Customer Segmentation?

Customer segmentation, which has an important place in marketing and sales strategies, means getting to know our customers well and dividing them into segments and placing them in a group. This segmentation process ensures a clear, targeted and efficient marketing success.

The most critical issue for us when it comes to segmentation is clean data. When you have clean data, it's time to analyze them. There is a great analysis to help us: RFM Analysis.

## What is the RFM Analysis?

It is a popular type of analysis used to identify the target customer audience by segmenting customers and reviewing past purchasing habits.

The meaning of the RFM;

#### Recency - The elapsed time since customers last made purchases.

#### Frequency - The frequency of customers' shopping.

#### Monetary - The amount of customers pay for their purchases.

Based on our customers' previous purchasing habits, scores are assigned to these three values. These scores are usually between 1 and 5. A value of 1 represents the lowest score and a value of 5 represents the highest score.

A score of 1 is assigned to the lowest of the Frequency and Monetary values, and 5 to the highest.

An important issue here is the score to be assigned to the Recency value. The reason for this is that the recency value, the date passed since the last purchase, is a good situation for us. Therefore, the highest score is assigned to the one with the smaller Recency value.

We segment our customers according to the assigned scores.

According to these segments, we can contribute to our company by developing strategies to win back, retain or increase the loyalty of our customers.

After informing about the subject, you can examine a sample in the attached notebook.
